Tell about yourself

Hi. My name is Emre.
I live in Turkey.
I'm thirty five years old and married.
I graduated with a degree in computer science at 2011.

My first experience in the IT industry was working remotely as a freelance manual tester, which provided me with valuable insights about what could be the possible bugs of an application and how to detect it.

For the past two years, I've been working as a remote Flutter developer. During this time, I've contributed to various projects that includes dekstop apps, android apps and responsive design for all devices.

To become a more well-rounded developer, I'm currently enrolled in a comprehensive program at Clarusway, with the aim of becoming a full-stack developer. 

I worked on many projects. You can see these on my github profile page.
I am highly motivated and passionate about development. I find great satisfaction in solving problems, writing clean code and sharing the success with team members.
