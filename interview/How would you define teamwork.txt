2- How would you define teamwork?
To me, teamwork is working closely with other people to achieve a shared goal.
I really enjoy teamwork because of two reason.The first reason is about increasing  experience and knowledge. Every person brings their own knowledge, skills and experience to the project. So everyone in the teamwork learn so much things from each other. The second reason I like teamwork is that we can celebrate our successes together.
I would also like to add that good communication is essential for teamwork so I always make sure my teammate understands me correctly and I also always make sure I understand my teammate  correctly
